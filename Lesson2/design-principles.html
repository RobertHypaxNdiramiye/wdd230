                Visual hierarchy means setting components in ascending or discending order of significance/importance.
                This can be done using color, size, images, contrast, typography, or simply the shape of an element or
                groups of elements. In the picture above you can see how a call to action button "Start Learning" is colorised
                and showcased by size in contrast to other buttons like "Bookmark" or "Download".

            <p>Negative Space which is also known as White Space, is the space that contains nothing on a web page. This Space
                makes it easy to read the content of a page and helps other detail become noticeable. A page without whitspace 
                looks overpopulated and unclean. In many case, readers tire quickly and move to another website when they fall on a webpage built 
                in this manner. You can see the use of white space in the picture above from The Odin Project Landing Page.

                Hick's law, or the Hick–Hyman law, named after the psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, describes that increasing the number of choices will increase the amount of time taken for an individual to make the decision.
                What helps us make a choice is therefor narrowing it down into categories. This is done very well by filters as shown in the example above. However, in general. it is best to present fewer choices that are useful to the user
                than a multitude that may make it difficult for them to choose.
